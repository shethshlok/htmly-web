    q: "Do I need to install or run anything?",
    a: "No. Htmly is hosted and remote-first. You only add a single URL to your AI client's config — there's no package to install and nothing running on your machine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which clients work with Htmly?",
    a: "Any MCP-compatible client that supports remote MCP transport: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code (Copilot Agent), and custom clients built on the MCP SDK.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do my previews stay online?",
    a: "Workspaces stay online for 24 hours. After that, stale links expire and the engine removes the hosted files to keep resource usage bounded.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I self-host it?",
    a: "Yes. Htmly is built with Bun and ships with a Dockerfile, so you can run your own instance and point BASE_URL at your own domain.",
